Google Sheets R API
---

Access and manage Google spreadsheets from R with `googlesheets`. 

Features:

  - Access a spreadsheet by its title, key or URL.
  - Extract data or edit data.
  - Create | delete | rename | copy | upload | download spreadsheets and worksheets.

`googlesheets` is inspired by [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread), a Google Spreadsheets Python API

The exuberant prose in this README is inspired by [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop): If you've ever wanted to get data in or out of a Google Spreadsheet from R without jumping through a thousand hoops, welcome home!

#### What the hell do I do with this?

Think of `googlesheets` as a read/write CMS that you (or your less R-obsessed friends) can edit through Google Docs, as well via R. It's like Christmas up in here.

Use a [Google Form](http://www.google.com/forms/about/) to conduct a survey, which populates a Google Sheet.

Gather data while you're in the field in a Google Sheet, maybe [with an iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-sheets/id842849113?mt=8) or [an Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en). Take advantage of [data validation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/139705?hl=en) to limit the crazy on the way in. You do not have to be online to edit a Google Sheet! Work offline via [the Chrome browser](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2375012?hl=en), the [Sheets app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en), or the [Sheets app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-sheets/id842849113?mt=8).

There are various ways to harvest web data directly into a Google Sheet. For example:

  * [This blog post](http://blog.aylien.com/post/114757623598/sentiment-analysis-of-restaurant-reviews) from Aylien.com has a simple example that uses the `=IMPORTXML()` formula to populate a Google Sheet with restaurant reviews and ratings from TripAdvisor.
  * Martin Hawksey offers [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info), a free Google Sheet template to setup and run automated collection of search results from Twitter.
  * Martin Hawksey also has a great blog post, [Feeding Google Spreadsheets](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/10/feeding-google-spreadsheets-exercises-in-import/), that demonstrates how functions like `importHTML`, `importFeed`, and `importXML` help you get data from the web into a Google Sheet with no programming.
  * Martin Hawksey has another blog post about [feeding a Google Sheet from IFTTT](https://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/09/ifttt-if-i-do-that-on-insert-social-networkrss-feedother-then-add-row-to-google-spreadsheet/). [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) stands for "if this, then that" and it's "a web-based service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, called 'recipes', which are triggered based on changes to other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, and Craigslist" (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT)).

Use `googlesheets` to get all that data into R.

Use it in a Shiny app! *[Several example apps](inst/shiny-examples) come with the package.*

What other ideas do you have?
  
### Install googlesheets

The released version is available on CRAN

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("googlesheets")
```

Or you can get the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/googlesheets")
```

If you use Windows, you may want to install the development version of `xml2`. This will improve handling of encoding when reading Sheets:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hadley/xml2")
```

### Vignettes

GitHub versions:

  * [Basic usage](https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/basic-usage.html)
  * [Formulas and formatted numbers](https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/formulas-and-formatted-numbers.html)
  * [Managing OAuth tokens](https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/managing-auth-tokens.html)

### Talks

  * [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/googlesheets-talk-at-user2015) for a talk in July 2015 at [useR! 2015](http://user2015.math.aau.dk)
  * [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/googlesheets-1) for an [rOpenSci Community Call in March 2016](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/9)

### Load googlesheets

`googlesheets` is designed for use with the `%>%` pipe operator and, to a lesser extent, the data-wrangling mentality of [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr). This README uses both, but the examples in the help files emphasize usage with plain vanilla R, if that's how you roll. `googlesheets` uses `dplyr` internally but does not require the user to do so. You can make the `%>%` pipe operator available in your own work by loading [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) or [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr).

```{r load-package}
library("googlesheets")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))
```

### Function naming convention

To play nicely with tab completion, we use consistent prefixes:

  * `gs_` = all functions in the package.
  * `gs_ws_` = all functions that operate on worksheets or tabs within a spreadsheet.
  * `gd_` = something to do with Google Drive, usually has a `gs_` synonym, might one day migrate to a Drive client.

### Quick demo

First, here's how to get a copy of a Gapminder-based Sheet we publish for practicing and follow along. You'll be sent to the browser to authenticate yourself with Google at this point.

```{r copy-gapminder, eval = FALSE}
gs_gap() %>% 
  gs_copy(to = "Gapminder")
## or, if you don't use pipes
gs_copy(gs_gap(), to = "Gapminder")
```

Register a Sheet (in this case, by title):

```{r}
gap <- gs_title("Gapminder")
```

Here's a registered `googlesheet` object:

```{r}
gap
```

Visit a registered `googlesheet` in the browser:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gap %>% gs_browse()
gap %>% gs_browse(ws = "Europe")
```

Read all the data in a worksheet:

```{r}
africa <- gs_read(gap)
str(africa)
head(africa)
```

Some of the many ways to target specific cells:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gap %>% gs_read(ws = 2, range = "A1:D8")
gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Europe", range = cell_rows(1:4))
gap %>% gs_read(ws = "Africa", range = cell_cols(1:4))
```

Full `readr`-style control of data ingest -- highly artificial example!

```{r}
gap %>%
  gs_read(ws = "Oceania", col_names = paste0("Z", 1:6),
          na = c("1962", "1977"), col_types = "cccccc", skip = 1, n_max = 7)
```

Create a new Sheet:

```{r}
iris_ss <- gs_new("iris", input = head(iris, 3), trim = TRUE)
```

Edit some arbitrary cells and append a row:

```{r}
iris_ss <- iris_ss %>% 
  gs_edit_cells(input = c("what", "is", "a", "sepal", "anyway?"),
                anchor = "A2", byrow = TRUE)
iris_ss <- iris_ss %>% 
  gs_add_row(input = c("sepals", "support", "the", "petals", "!!"))
```

Look at what we have wrought:

```{r}
iris_ss %>% 
  gs_read()
```

Download this precious thing (other formats are possible):

```{r}
iris_ss %>% 
  gs_download(to = "iris-ish-stuff.csv", overwrite = TRUE)
```

Clean up our mess:

```{r eval = FALSE}
gs_vecdel(c("iris", "Gapminder"))
file.remove("iris-ish-stuff.csv")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
gs_delete(iris_ss)
file.remove("iris-ish-stuff.csv")
```

Remember, [the vignette](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/blob/master/vignettes/basic-usage.md) shows a lot more usage.
