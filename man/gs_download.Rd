\description{
Export a Google Sheet as a .csv, .pdf, or .xlsx file. You can download a
sheet that you own or a sheet owned by a third party that has been made
accessible via the sharing dialog options. You can download the entire
spreadsheet (.pdf and .xlsx formats only) or a single worksheet (all
formats). This function calls the
\href{https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/}{Google Drive API}.
}
\details{
If the worksheet is unspecified, i.e. if \code{ws = NULL}, then the entire
spreadsheet will be exported (.pdf and xlsx formats) or the first worksheet
will be exported (.csv format)
